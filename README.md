# Image-to-Image-Translation-with-cGAN
# Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional GAN (cGAN)

Welcome to the Image-to-Image Translation project using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN). This project demonstrates how cGANs can be used to transform images from one domain to another, such as converting black and white images to color, day images to night, and more.

## Introduction

Image-to-Image Translation is a task in computer vision where the goal is to learn a mapping from an input image to an output image. Conditional GANs (cGANs) are a type of generative adversarial network that conditions the generation process on some input data. This project uses cGANs to perform various image-to-image translation tasks.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Image-to-Image-Translation.git
cd Image-to-Image-Translation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the dataset**: Place your training and testing images in the `data/train` and `data/test` directories, respectively.
2. **Train the model**: Run the training script to start the training process.
    ```bash
    python scripts/train.py
    ```
3. **Evaluate the model**: After training, you can evaluate the model on the test dataset.
    ```bash
    python scripts/evaluate.py
    ```

## Training

To train the model, run the `train.py` script. You can specify various training parameters such as the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate in the script or as command-line arguments.

```bash
python scripts/train.py --epochs 100 --batch_size 16 --learning_rate 0.0002
```

## Evaluation

To evaluate the trained model, run the `evaluate.py` script. This will generate translated images from the test set and save them in the `results/images` directory.

```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py
```

## Results

After training and evaluation, you can find the generated images in the `results/images` directory. Logs and other training artifacts are saved in the `results/logs` directory.
